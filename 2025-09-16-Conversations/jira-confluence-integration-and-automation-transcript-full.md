# jira–confluence-integration-and-automation — conversation transcript (full)

> **Note:** This is a verbatim-style transcript of the conversation directly above. Code/config snippets are preserved inside fenced code blocks.

**User:**  
My company uses jira to track projects in an agile way. No rather then having on large comprehensive requirements document - we have features split piecemeal all across different jira tickets without a coherent view of them 

Is there anyway to collate or aggregate this information?

**Assistant:**  
You’ve stumbled into one of the big paradoxes of Jira: it’s excellent for tracking atomic units of work (tickets, stories, bugs), but terrible at stitching those into a coherent “big picture” unless you deliberately build that layer. What you’re describing is basically *requirements scattered like confetti*. To pull them back into a coherent view, there are a few strategies:

---

### Native Jira Features
- **Epics and Initiatives:** Jira supports hierarchy (story → epic → initiative, depending on your setup). If your team isn’t using Epics (or higher-level structures in Advanced Roadmaps), they’re the first step toward grouping fragmented tickets into coherent features.
- **Advanced Roadmaps (a.k.a. Portfolio):** This adds cross-project views, hierarchy levels above epics, dependency mapping, and a timeline view. It can serve as a pseudo-requirements document if you enforce consistent usage.
- **Saved Filters + Dashboards:** Jira’s query language (JQL) lets you pull in all related issues and display them on a dashboard, table, or even a Confluence page. You can embed these to act as a “living requirements doc.”

---

### Confluence Integration
Atlassian pretty much assumes you’ll use Confluence for the big-picture. Confluence pages can:
- Embed Jira query results dynamically (so they always update).
- Let you organize requirements at a narrative/document level while pulling in the granular tickets that represent implementation details.
This is the closest Atlassian-native approach to replacing a traditional requirements spec.

---

### Third-Party Plugins / Apps
There’s a whole ecosystem on the Atlassian Marketplace:
- **Structure**: lets you build hierarchical trees of Jira issues far beyond the basic Epic/Story relationship. Great for creating “mini-PRDs.”
- **BigPicture**: adds Gantt charts, program boards, and feature hierarchies, useful if you want a project-manager’s bird’s-eye view.
- **Requirements Yogi**: explicitly built for managing requirements inside Jira, with traceability matrices, baselining, and Confluence integration.
- **Easy Agile User Story Maps**: lets you create story maps visually, aligning user journeys with Jira tickets.

---

### Export / External Aggregation
If you don’t want to live inside Jira’s ecosystem:
- **Export to Markdown / Word / PDF** (via plugins or API) and assemble requirements externally.
- **Jira REST API**: You can query for epics, stories, custom fields, etc. and generate your own aggregated “living document” in whatever format suits you (say, a nightly-generated Confluence page or even GitHub repo of specs).
- **ETL into a database**: Some companies extract Jira data into a warehouse, then build reports in BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker) to provide that higher-level requirements coherence.

---

### The Trade-Off
Jira deliberately keeps requirements fragmented because Agile assumes requirements evolve. But if you need a “requirements spine” to hold all those fragments together, the two best routes are:
1. **Jira + Confluence combo** for a more narrative/document-like experience.  
2. **Plugins like Structure or Requirements Yogi** if you want that structure to stay *inside* Jira.

---

Would you like me to lean into the **Atlassian-native approaches** (Confluence + Jira setup) or explore **more technical API/export automation** options, where you build your own aggregator?

---

**User:**  
Explain how jira works with confluence

**Assistant:**  
Jira and Confluence are like two halves of Atlassian’s brain. Jira is all about **granularity and tracking** (tickets, workflow states, sprints, epics), while Confluence is all about **narrative and context** (requirements docs, meeting notes, architecture write-ups). By design, Atlassian wants you to use them together so that the “scattered Lego bricks” in Jira can be stacked into coherent models in Confluence.  

Here’s how they mesh:

---

### Linking Issues to Documents
- In Confluence, you can insert a **Jira Issue macro** anywhere (a table, a paragraph, even a bulleted list). That macro pulls live data from Jira—status, assignee, priority—so your Confluence doc always reflects reality without needing a copy-paste.
- You can paste a Jira issue URL into Confluence, and it’ll unfurl into a smart link showing the ticket title and status.
- Conversely, in Jira you can see a panel of **“linked Confluence pages”** for a ticket. For example: a “Login Feature Spec” page in Confluence might link to ten Jira stories for implementation.

---

### Structuring Requirements
- In Confluence, you can write a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** template. Inside it, you drop in dynamic Jira queries (using JQL) to list all issues tagged with `component = Authentication` or `Epic = Login`.
- This turns your Confluence page into a kind of “living index” of requirements, where the high-level description sits at the top and the granular Jira issues populate beneath.
- You can group multiple PRDs together into a **requirements space** in Confluence, giving you the big-picture view Jira itself lacks.

---

### Reporting and Dashboards
- Jira dashboards are great for developers, but they’re too granular for execs or stakeholders. Confluence can embed **Jira reports**—like burndown charts, sprint progress, or roadmap views—into narrative pages that explain *why* those numbers matter.
- A Confluence “Status Update” page can pull in Jira queries showing “all done items in Sprint 14” or “open blockers on Epic XYZ.”

---

### Workflow Glue
- Teams often set up a **workflow convention**: “Every Epic must have a linked Confluence requirements page.” This ensures every chunk of work has a big-picture anchor.
- Permissions: Jira might be locked down for engineers, but Confluence is often open to the broader org. That way, product managers, marketing, or execs can see polished requirements and status without poking around raw Jira boards.

---

### A Simple Example
Imagine you’re building a “Password Reset” feature:  
- **Confluence page**: “Password Reset Spec” with narrative, user flows, diagrams, acceptance criteria. At the bottom, a Jira macro lists all stories in the “Password Reset Epic.”  
- **Jira side**: Epic + stories (UI form, backend email, token validation). Each ticket shows a link back to the Confluence page, so developers know the narrative context.  

Together, you get both **traceability** (every requirement has implementation tickets) and **context** (every ticket links back to a bigger picture).  

---

The real trick is discipline: if teams don’t enforce linking, Jira and Confluence drift apart into “two separate universes.” But when tied together well, they create a cycle—requirements in Confluence feed work into Jira, and Jira’s status updates feed visibility back into Confluence.  

Would you like me to sketch a **workflow template** that shows how to set up a feature spec in Confluence and connect it to Jira tickets so they stay in sync?

---

**User:**  
Yes

**Assistant:**  
Perfect—let’s build a working template you could actually roll out. Think of this as a skeleton that your product manager, tech lead, or even you could copy-paste into Confluence for each new feature, then connect it to Jira.  

---

## 🔧 Confluence–Jira Feature Spec Template

**Page Title:**  
`Feature: <Descriptive Name>`  

---

### 1. Overview  
Explain the “why” in plain language.  
- **Business Goal:** e.g., Improve account recovery to reduce customer churn.  
- **Problem Statement:** Users can’t reset their password without contacting support.  
- **Outcome / Success Metrics:** e.g., 80% self-service reset success rate.  

---

### 2. User Stories / Use Cases  
List the scenarios, ideally written in user-story format.  
- As a user, I want to request a password reset email.  
- As a user, I want to securely create a new password via a token.  

*(Optional: link to a user journey diagram or mockups here.)*

---

### 3. Requirements & Acceptance Criteria  
Define what “done” looks like.  
- Must send reset email within 30 seconds.  
- Token expires in 30 minutes.  
- Works on web and mobile flows.  

---

### 4. Jira Issues (Live Embed)  
Here’s the magic. Use the **Jira Issue/Filter macro** in Confluence to show tickets dynamically. Example JQL:  
```JQL
project = APP 
AND "Epic Link" = RESET-123
ORDER BY priority DESC
```  
This table will auto-populate with all related Jira issues:  
- [RESET-201: Build reset form]  
- [RESET-202: Email service]  
- [RESET-203: Token validation API]  

*(These links are live; their status will always reflect Jira.)*

---

### 5. Dependencies / Risks  
- Requires email service upgrade.  
- Security review needed for token handling.  

---

### 6. Status Reporting  
Embed Jira sprint reports or burndown charts directly here. For example:  
- Sprint burndown for “Sprint 14”  
- Roadmap view of Epic RESET-123  

---

### 7. Linked Resources  
- Design mockups (Figma link)  
- Architecture diagram (Lucidchart, Miro, or draw.io)  
- Related Confluence pages (e.g., “Account Security Requirements”)  

---

## How it Connects to Jira
1. **Create Epic in Jira** → “Password Reset” (RESET-123).  
2. Break into Stories/Tasks.  
3. On each Jira ticket, link back to this Confluence page under “Issue Links” → “Documents.”  
4. In Confluence, add the Jira Epic filter macro so all issues stay visible.  

Now:  
- Engineers work in Jira tickets.  
- Product/management sees the “story + progress” view in Confluence.  
- Neither side has to manually update the other—status flows automatically.  

---

This setup basically turns Confluence into your “requirements spine” and Jira into your “execution muscles.” Together, they walk upright instead of crawling in circles.  

Would you like me to also show you how to **automate the linking** (so every new Epic in Jira automatically gets a Confluence template page created and linked), or do you prefer sticking with a manual process for now?

---

**User:**  
Yes

**Assistant:**  
Great—let’s dive into **automation**, because this is where Jira + Confluence stop being just two apps and start acting like one system. You’ve got a couple of paths, depending on how much tooling you want to wrangle.

---

## 1. Automation Inside Jira Cloud (No Code)
Jira has a built-in **Automation Rules** engine. You can use it to trigger the creation of Confluence pages whenever new issues are made.

**Example flow:**
- **Trigger:** When an Epic is created.  
- **Action:** “Send web request” → calls Confluence REST API to create a page from a template.  
- **Optional:** Add a comment to the Epic with a link to the new page.  

This requires a bit of setup because Jira doesn’t have a first-class “create Confluence page” action yet, but the web request step + Confluence API does the trick.

---

## 2. Confluence Templates + Blueprints
You can create a **Confluence template** (like the Feature Spec I outlined earlier). Then:
- Use the Confluence REST API or apps like **ScriptRunner** to instantiate that template when Jira events happen.
- Many teams use a “requirements space” in Confluence where each Epic auto-generates its own subpage.

---

## 3. Marketplace Plugins (Easier)
If you don’t want to script:
- **Appfire’s ScriptRunner**: lets you wire Jira and Confluence together with simple Groovy scripts or rules.  
- **Elements Publish to Confluence**: lets you push Jira fields into Confluence pages automatically.  
- **Automation for Jira (Cloud/Server)**: integrates with Confluence out of the box on some plans.  

These handle authentication, templating, and page creation without you fiddling with raw API calls.

---

## 4. DIY with REST API
If you’re comfortable with code, you can script this yourself.

**Confluence API call to create a page from template:**
```http
POST /wiki/rest/api/content
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic <base64 API token>

{
  "type": "page",
  "title": "Feature: Password Reset",
  "space": { "key": "ENG" },
  "ancestors": [{ "id": 123456 }], 
  "body": {
    "storage": {
      "value": "<p>PRD Template here...</p>",
      "representation": "storage"
    }
  }
}
```
- `ancestors` ensures the new page is placed under the right parent (e.g., your “Requirements” hub).  
- You can inject the Epic key and summary directly into the title/body, so the page is automatically tied to the ticket.  

Pair that with a Jira Automation rule that fires on Epic creation → boom, auto-linked PRD page.

---

## 5. Workflow Convention (Semi-Automation)
If full automation feels heavy-handed, a lighter option is:
- Create a **“Create from Template” button** in Confluence for your Requirements space.  
- When a PM creates an Epic in Jira, they immediately click “New Page from Template” in Confluence, paste the Epic key in, and the link is done.  
This keeps human oversight but still keeps things standardized.

---

### The Trade-Off
- **Full automation:** Great for consistency, but can feel rigid if your team experiments a lot.  
- **Semi-automation:** Keeps flexibility, but requires discipline to not skip the “make the page” step.  

---

Want me to sketch a **Jira automation rule JSON** you could import straight into Jira Cloud, so you’d be 90% of the way to auto-linking Epics → Confluence pages?

---

**User:**  
Sure

**Assistant:**  
Heck yes. Here’s a **ready-to-import Jira Automation rule** that creates a Confluence PRD page the moment a new **Epic** is created, then comments on the Epic with a link to that page. It uses the **“Send web request”** action to call the Confluence REST API, injects Epic smart-values (key/summary), and embeds a live **Jira Issues macro** (by JQL) so the page always lists the Epic’s stories.

---

# What you’ll need first
1. **Your Atlassian Cloud domain** (replace `your-domain.atlassian.net` everywhere).
2. **Confluence Space Key** where pages should live (replace `ENG`).
3. **Parent Page ID** in Confluence under which these PRDs should be created (replace `123456`).
4. **Confluence API token** created under your Atlassian account.  
   - Auth header = `Basic <base64(email:api_token)>`
5. Jira Automation permissions that allow **Send web request**.

---

# Importable Jira Automation (JSON)

> In Jira: **Project settings → Automation → Import rule → Paste JSON**.

```json

    },
    {
      "component": "com.atlassian.automation.core.action.LogAction",
      "message": "Confluence created page id: {{webResponse.body.id}}; link: {{webResponse.body._links.base}}{{webResponse.body._links.webui}}"
    },
    {
      "component": "com.atlassian.automation.core.action.CommentIssue",
      "comment": {
        "type": "plain",
        "text": "PRD created in Confluence: {{webResponse.body._links.base}}{{webResponse.body._links.webui}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**What it does**
- **Trigger:** any new issue that’s an **Epic**.
- **Send web request:** POSTS to Confluence `/rest/api/content` to create a page:
  - Title: `Feature: <Epic Summary> (<Epic Key>)`
  - Space: `ENG`
  - Parent: page id `123456`
  - Body: Confluence **storage format** with a live **Jira Issues macro** where JQL is `"Epic Link" = {{issue.key}}`.
- **Log + Comment:** stores the created page’s URL and comments it onto the Epic so people can click straight in.

---

## Minimal changes you must make
- Replace `your-domain.atlassian.net` (twice).
- Replace `ENG` with your Confluence **Space Key**.
- Replace `123456` with your **parent page id**.
- Replace the **Authorization** header with your real base64 string.

**Getting the base64 token**
- Concatenate `email:api_token`, then base64-encode it.
- Example (Mac/Linux):  
  ```bash
  printf 'you@example.com:ATLT...your-api-token...' | base64
  ```
  Paste the result in the header after `Basic `.

---

## Optional: make the page richer out of the gate
You can safely edit the storage body to include headings like “User Stories”, “Acceptance Criteria”, or diagrams. The key bit is the **Jira macro**:

```xml
<ac:structured-macro ac:name="jira">
  <ac:parameter ac:name="server">This server</ac:parameter>
  <ac:parameter ac:name="columns">key,summary,status,assignee,priority</ac:parameter>
  <ac:parameter ac:name="jqlQuery">"Epic Link" = {{issue.key}}</ac:parameter>
</ac:structured-macro>
```

That macro keeps the Confluence page **live**—as stories are added/updated in Jira, the table auto-updates.

---

## Testing quickly (without Automation)
Use curl (swap placeholders):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content"   -H "Authorization: Basic REPLACE_WITH_BASE64_EMAIL_COLON_API_TOKEN"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{
    "type":"page",
    "title":"Feature: Sample (APP-123)",
    "space":{"key":"ENG"},
    "ancestors":[{"id":123456}],
    "body":{"storage":{
      "value":"<p>Hello from API</p>",
      "representation":"storage"
    }}
  }'
```

If that works, your Automation rule will too.

---

## Variations you might want later
- **Scope:** change the trigger condition to only run when `labels`, `components`, or `project` match.
- **Two-way linking:** in addition to the comment, add a **Confluence Smart Link** to the Epic’s *“Web links”* field using the “Add comment” action (Jira will unfurl it nicely).
- **Data Center / Server:** same structure, but the URL is your Confluence base URL (no `/wiki` path if your setup differs).
- **Security:** if your org requires OAuth instead of API tokens, use an **Outgoing link** / **OAuth 2.0** connection in Automation and select it in the web request action.

---

If you want, I can tweak the JSON to match your actual domain, space key, and parent page id—and also add a second action that back-links the Epic URL *onto the Confluence page body* so it’s truly bi-directional from the first second.
