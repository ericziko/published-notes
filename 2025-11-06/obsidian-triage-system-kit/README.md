## ⚙️ Required Plugins

1. **Dataview** — for dynamic tables and queries.  
2. **Tasks** — for tracking actionable todos.

Ensure both are installed and enabled in your Obsidian settings.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Daily Workflow
1. Create a new Daily Note from the `daily-triage.md` template.
2. Capture tasks and notes as they occur throughout the day.
3. At day’s end, process the inbox — either move tasks into project notes or mark them complete.

### Weekly Review
Use `weekly-review.md` to:
- Reflect on accomplishments.
- Review open tasks.
- Plan the next week’s focus.

### Projects
Each `project-template.md` provides structure for defining outcomes, linking resources, and tracking progress.

### Triage Dashboard
`triage-dashboard.md` pulls together all uncompleted tasks and sorts by due date and priority.

## 🧠 Tips
- Keep Daily Notes short — they’re your *staging area*, not your archive.
- Use `#urgent`, `#important`, and `#later` tags to sort dynamically.
- Schedule a weekly “triage session” to clear your inbox and refresh focus.

Enjoy your new streamlined Obsidian system!
