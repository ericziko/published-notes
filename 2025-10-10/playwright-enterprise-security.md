# playwright-enterprise-security

**User:**  
How can Enterprises lock the security down on Microsoft playwright and what kind of security issues are there around allow allowing enterprise users to use it

**Assistant:**  
Short version: Playwright is "just code" that can fully drive a real browser. That power cuts both ways. Enterprises should treat it like any other code that can touch production data and the open internet: constrain what it can install, where it can talk, what it can record, and what it can leak.

Here's a practical, enterprise-grade checklist—with toggles you can actually flip—plus why they matter.

## 1) Lock down installs & browsers (supply chain)

- **Pin versions + lock files** for `@playwright/test` and friends; build from a **private registry/cache** (Artifactory/Nexus). Generate an SBOM and scan it like you would any other prod dependency.  
- **Skip auto browser downloads** and ship blessed binaries from an internal mirror; or force installs into a known path.  
  - `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` to avoid fetching from the public CDN. citeturn1search12  
  - Use `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to control where binaries live. citeturn1search16
- If you **must** fetch, route through your **corporate proxy** and restrict egress. Playwright respects proxy env vars; document this in CI images. citeturn1search7turn1search19
- For orgs with strict compliance (PII/PHI), several agencies explicitly require FIPS-validated crypto and approved browser bundles; mirror that stance internally. citeturn0search9
- Report Playwright vulnerabilities via **MSRC** like any other Microsoft OSS. citeturn0search5

## 2) Constrain network & environment (blast radius)

- **Default-deny egress.** Allowlist only the domains your tests need. Use Playwright's request routing to **fail closed** on any unexpected calls (mock/HAR where possible). citeturn1search8
- **Do not** launch browsers with insecure flags (e.g., `--disable-web-security`) or set `use.bypassCSP=true` unless your threat model explicitly permits it; both bypass app protections. Keep `ignoreHTTPSErrors=false` unless you control the CA. citeturn0search6turn0search10
- Run tests in **ephemeral containers/VMs** as a non-privileged user; mount a **throwaway downloads directory** and nuke it post-run.
- Expect **Enterprise Browser Policies** to affect control of Chrome/Edge; stick to the Playwright-bundled browsers or manage the policy exceptions explicitly. citeturn0search3turn0search7

## 3) Secrets, auth, and test data

- **Never hardcode creds.** Pull short-lived tokens from your secret store and scope them to test-only roles.  
- Use **`storageState`** for session reuse to avoid re-typing passwords in every test, but **treat the file like a secret** (do not commit; rotate). citeturn2search1turn2search10
- Prefer **API-level login** to seed cookies/localStorage rather than typing secrets into UI fields. citeturn2search23

## 4) Recording, tracing, logs: assume they leak

Playwright can capture **screenshots, videos, traces, console/network logs**—great for debugging, terrible for secrets if you're careless.
- Set **conservative defaults**:  

  ```ts
  // playwright.config.ts
  use: {
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',  // not 'on' by default
    video: 'retain-on-failure',  // or 'off' in prod CI
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure'
  }
  ```

  Videos are **off by default**; keep them that way unless needed. citeturn2search9
- Redaction/masking: Playwright doesn't yet guarantee redaction of sensitive input text in traces/logs; this is an open request. So **mask at the source** (custom helpers, CI log filters) and restrict artifact access/retention. citeturn2search0turn2search12
- If you use a **cloud test grid** (e.g., BrowserStack), enable their **masking features** and disable Playwright's verbose logs. citeturn2search2turn2search21

## 5) Principle-of-least-privilege in the browser

- Grant **no permissions** by default (`use.permissions=[]`), only what a test needs (e.g., `notifications`). citeturn0search6
- **Disable downloads** unless required; if enabled, sandbox the folder and auto-delete after runs.  
- Keep **JavaScript enabled** unless testing progressive enhancement; if you disable it for security scenarios, do so per-test with `use.javaScriptEnabled=false`. citeturn1search14

## 6) CI/CD posture

- Use **OIDC-based federation** or short-lived secrets in CI; lock down runners to private networks.  
- **Mask logs**, keep **artifact TTLs short**, and segregate projects (dev vs prod) to prevent cross-environment bleed. The Playwright docs' CI section covers secret handling patterns. citeturn0search14
- Gate merges on both **security scans** (deps + container) and **test artifacts** policy checks (e.g., no raw screenshots from prod tenants).

## 7) Risk scenarios to include in your threat model

- **Supply-chain**: unpinned browser/ffmpeg downloads; mitigate with internal mirrors and `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD`. citeturn1search12  
- **Data exfiltration**: tests posting real PII to third-party services; mitigate with network mocks/HAR and allowlists. citeturn1search8  
- **Policy bypass**: enabling `bypassCSP` or insecure launch flags to "make a test pass." Disallow in code review and enforce via config linting. citeturn0search6  
- **Artifact leakage**: secrets visible in traces/videos/screenshots. Default "off/retain-on-failure," redact, and restrict access. citeturn2search9turn2search0  
- **Enterprise browser policy conflicts**: hardened Chrome/Edge may block automation; plan for exceptions or use bundled browsers. citeturn0search3turn0search7

## Minimal hardened baseline (copy/paste)

**Config guardrails**

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: 2,
  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.E2E_BASE_URL,          // points to test env by default
    storageState: process.env.PW_STORAGE_STATE,  // secret path in CI
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    permissions: [],                             // allowlist per test
    bypassCSP: false,
    ignoreHTTPSErrors: false,                    // require trusted CA in CI
  },
  reporter: [['html', { open: 'never' }]]        // store securely with short TTL
});
```

**Install policy**

```bash
# In Dockerfile / CI job:
export PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1            # ship approved binaries
export PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers    # controlled location
# browsers come from internal artifact store; no public egress
```

**Network guard (example)**

```ts
test.beforeEach(async ({ context }) => {
  await context.route('**/*', route => {
    const url = route.request().url();
    const allowed = ['https://idp.test.corp/', 'https://api.test.corp/', 'https://app.test.corp/'];
    return allowed.some(p => url.startsWith(p)) ? route.continue() : route.abort();
  });
});
```

(Uses Playwright's network routing to enforce an **allowlist** at runtime.) citeturn1search8

**User:**  
Can you elaborate on?

Supply-chain: unpinned browser/ffmpeg downloads; mitigate with internal mirrors and PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD.  

What do you mean by FFMPEG downloads

**Assistant:**  
Good catch — it's an easy one to gloss over, but it matters.  

When you install **Playwright**, it doesn't just pull JavaScript packages. It also downloads the **browser executables** (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and certain **binary helper tools**, among them a **patched copy of FFmpeg**.  

Here's why and how that happens:

### What FFmpeg is doing there

FFmpeg is an open-source library for handling audio/video encoding, decoding, and container formats. Playwright uses it behind the scenes to:
- Record test **videos** (`use.video = 'on'` or `'retain-on-failure'`).
- Capture **network traces** that include media requests.
- Support browsers that rely on FFmpeg codecs for playback (Chromium in particular needs dynamic linking to a compatible FFmpeg build).

Because of codec licensing issues, Playwright ships its own prebuilt FFmpeg binaries instead of relying on whatever is in the host OS.  

### Why that's a supply-chain risk

- Each install may **fetch those binaries from Microsoft's public CDN** (usually `playwright.azureedge.net`), outside your corporate perimeter.  
- The files are **executable code**. If a mirror or CDN were compromised, an attacker could inject a malicious binary into your CI or developer environment.  
- They can also be **inconsistent across installs**—different OSes, architectures, or Playwright versions may pull different builds, complicating reproducibility and compliance scans.  

### How to mitigate

To avoid uncontrolled downloads:
1. **Set**

   ```bash
   PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
   ```

   during your `npm install` so no browsers or FFmpeg are fetched automatically.
2. **Mirror Playwright's browser/FFmpeg bundle internally** once, scan it, and make it available behind your firewall.  
   - Store it in Artifactory, Nexus, or an internal blob store.
3. **Point installs to that mirror** by setting

   ```bash
   PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers
   ```

   or equivalent in your CI/Docker image.
4. **Pre-populate** that path with vetted browser/FFmpeg binaries:

   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps chromium firefox webkit
   ```

   (run once in a clean build host, then distribute the directory as a tarball or package).

### The upshot

FFmpeg isn't something you'd normally think about when securing browser automation, but it's part of the binary payload. Enterprises with strict supply-chain policies (banks, healthcare, government) typically freeze Playwright versions, pre-download these binaries, and treat them like any other third-party executable — signed, scanned, and served from a trusted internal source.  

In short: FFmpeg in this context is a silent helper that enables video recording and media playback, but from a security perspective, it's just another executable entering your environment — so it needs the same scrutiny as the browsers themselves.
