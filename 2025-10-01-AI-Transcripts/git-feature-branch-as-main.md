title: git-feature-branch-as-main
summary: The conversation explored how to make Git treat a feature branch as if it were the main branch. We discussed different approaches including renaming the branch to `main`, changing the upstream tracking branch, adjusting Git’s symbolic `HEAD` to point to the feature branch, and setting local configuration or aliases so tooling and scripts recognize the feature branch as the new default.
joke: "*Git branches are like toddlers: they all think they’re the main character.*"

### 🙋 question: treat feature branch as main
> I'm working off a feature branch in and I want the git client to treat it as if it was main

### ℹ️ AI response : ways to treat feature branch as main
> Got it — you're saying you've got a feature branch checked out, but you'd like your local Git setup to behave as if that branch were your "main" branch. There are a couple of different flavors of what "treat it like main" could mean, so let's walk through the most common interpretations:
> 
> ---
> 
> **1. Rename the branch to `main`**
> ```bash
> # While on your feature branch
> git branch -m main
> ```
> If you already have a `main`, you can rename or delete it:
> ```bash
> git branch -m main old-main
> git branch -m feature-branch main
> ```
> 
> **2. Change the default upstream tracking**
> ```bash
> git push -u origin feature-branch:main
> ```
> This makes pushes from the feature branch go to `origin/main` by default.
> 
> **3. Set HEAD to point to your feature branch**
> ```bash
> git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/feature-branch
> ```
> This sets the repo's default branch reference.
> 
> **4. Adjust for tooling and CI/CD**
> ```bash
> git config branch.main.merge refs/heads/feature-branch
> ```
> Or create an alias:
> ```bash
> git config alias.main 'checkout feature-branch'
> ```
> 
> ---
> 
> The right choice depends on whether you mean "rename it," "push it as main," or "point Git's defaults at it."  
> The follow-up is whether you want this just locally or to replace `main` in the repo.

## 📌 Continuation Note
This conversation naturally extends into related territory: how distributed teams decide when a feature branch should *become* the canonical branch, strategies for rebasing vs merging before promoting, and the cultural shift of treating "main" as a movable concept. Diving into Git workflows like **trunk-based development**, **GitFlow**, or **GitHub Flow** could show how "main" isn't just a branch name but a workflow philosophy.
