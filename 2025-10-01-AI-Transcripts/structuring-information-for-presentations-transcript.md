title: Structuring information for a good presentation
summary: |
  We discussed practical strategies for structuring a presentation so it is clear, memorable, and action‑oriented—covering a core message, the “tell them” formula, narrative arcs, the rule of three, cognitive load, signposting, strong endings, and pacing. The conversation then turned to a request for a formal transcript with specific formatting and metadata requirements.
joke: Presentations are like sandwiches—the structure matters, because nobody remembers a talk where the filling fell out halfway through.

*Presentations are like sandwiches—the structure matters, because nobody remembers a talk where the filling fell out halfway through.*

### 🙋 **Human:**
Can you give me some good tips around structuring information for a good presentation?

### 🤖 **AI:**
A presentation is essentially a guided journey through ideas. The trick is to make the path clear, the scenery interesting, and the destination memorable. Here are some practical, field-tested ways to structure information so your audience stays with you instead of drifting off to daydream about lunch:  

---

### 1. Anchor Everything to a Single Core Message
Imagine your presentation is a tree: your **core message** is the trunk, and every branch (section, story, graph) must connect back to it. If a slide or point doesn’t grow from the trunk, prune it.

---

### 2. Use the “Tell Them” Formula
This classic works because the human brain likes to know where it is in the story:
- **Tell them what you’re going to tell them** (outline, context, why it matters).  
- **Tell them** (main content, step by step).  
- **Tell them what you told them** (recap, key takeaways, call to action).  

It sounds repetitive, but repetition is the secret sauce of memory.

---

### 3. Story > Data Dump
Brains crave narrative. Even in technical talks, wrap your data in story arcs:
- **Problem → Struggle → Resolution** (classic arc).  
- Or **Before → After → Bridge** (show the transformation your idea enables).  

If you’re showing charts, don’t just say “Here are the numbers.” Say, “This is where things broke down… and this is where we fixed it.”

---

### 4. The Rule of Three
People remember things in threes (three little pigs, three musketeers, etc.). Organize your main content into **three big buckets**—even if you actually have six points, cluster them under three umbrellas.

---

### 5. Design for Cognitive Load
Don’t make your audience juggle flaming bowling balls of information:
- **One idea per slide**.  
- **Minimal text**, maximum clarity.  
- Use visuals to carry half the weight—diagrams, icons, or even metaphorical images to lock concepts into memory.

---

### 6. Keep Signposts Visible
Audiences get lost easily. Use verbal and visual cues like:  
- “Now we’re moving into the second challenge.”  
- Slide headers that act like road signs (“Problem,” “Solution,” “Results”).  
This way, even if someone zones out for a moment, they can rejoin without panic.

---

### 7. End with a Bang, Not a Whimper
Don’t trail off with “Well, that’s it.” End with a **takeaway or call to action**:  
- “If you remember one thing from today, let it be this…”  
- “Here’s how you can use this tomorrow.”  

Audiences are more likely to act if you give them a next step.

---

### 8. Bonus: Think Like a Movie Director
Vary your pacing. Mix short, punchy moments with longer explanations. Insert a surprise (unexpected stat, quirky image, rhetorical question) every so often. Presentations, like films, need rhythm to keep attention alive.

---

Would you like me to give you a **ready-to-use skeleton outline** (like a template) that you can plug your own topic into, so it’s presentation-ready?
