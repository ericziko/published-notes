*I tried to keep a straight face writing about Markdown, but the :shipit: squirrel kept approving my punchlines with a :rocket:.*

### User
what features are unique to github flavored markdown

### Assistant
GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) starts with standard Markdown, then sprinkles in some features GitHub needed for code, collaboration, and issue-tracking. Here are the unique parts you won't find in "vanilla" Markdown:

**1. Tables**  
GFM supports pipe (`|`) syntax tables without requiring HTML. You can align columns with colons.  
```markdown
| Name  | Age | City      |
|:------|:---:|-----------|
| Alice |  30 | New York  |
| Bob   |  25 | San Diego |
```

**2. Task Lists (Checkboxes)**  
You can make interactive checklists in issues, PRs, and comments.  
```markdown
- [ ] Unchecked task
- [x] Checked task
```

**3. Automatic URL Linking**  
Plain URLs become clickable automatically:  
```
https://github.com
```
→ <https://github.com>

**4. Strikethrough**  
Double tilde syntax works:  
```markdown
~~This is crossed out~~
```

**5. Extended Code Blocks**  
Fenced code blocks (```) allow syntax highlighting with language hints.  

```markdown
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, GitHub!");
```

**6. Emoji Shortcodes**  
GitHub recognizes `:emoji:` names.  
```markdown
:rocket: :tada:
→ 🚀 🎉
```

**7. Mentions & References**  
- `@username` pings a GitHub user.  
- `#123` links to an issue or PR.  
- `owner/repo#123` links across repos.  
- Commit SHAs auto-link to commits.  

**8. Tables of Contents (via headers)**  
Not a syntax feature, but GitHub automatically generates a "Contents" sidebar from your headers in `.md` files.

**9. Alerts/Callouts (lesser-known)**  
Not official Markdown, but GitHub docs now support special blockquote syntax like:  
```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note.
```
That renders styled callouts in GitHub's documentation platform (not in all repos).

---

So, the "GitHub flavor" is basically:  
**tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks, emoji shortcodes, mentions/refs, and better fenced code**. Everything else is just Markdown, but tuned for collaboration.  

Would you like me to make you a **side-by-side cheat sheet** showing standard Markdown vs GFM extras? That way you can quickly spot what's truly unique.

### User
tell me more about alerts and callouts

### Assistant
Alerts and callouts are a neat little GitHub extension—sort of "Markdown++" rather than pure GFM. They're not part of the CommonMark spec, and you won't see them in every repo, but GitHub **uses them in its documentation and wiki system**.  

They work by piggybacking on blockquotes. Normally, in Markdown, you'd do:  

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

But GitHub has a special syntax where you add `[!TYPE]` as the first line of the blockquote:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note.

> [!TIP]
> This is a tip.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is important.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution.
```

On GitHub's docs site, these render with **fancy colored boxes and icons** (blue for NOTE, green for TIP, yellow for IMPORTANT, orange for WARNING, red for CAUTION). It's similar to what you'd see in Docusaurus or MkDocs with their "admonition" blocks.  

### Where they work
- ✅ GitHub Docs pages (like developer.github.com, docs.github.com)  
- ✅ GitHub's internal markdown engine for help articles  
- ❌ Plain `.md` files in your repo won't render them with the styling—they'll just look like boring blockquotes with `[!NOTE]` text.

So they're half-way between "standard GFM" and "GitHub Docs Markdown extensions."  

### Why they exist
They let writers add **semantic emphasis** beyond bold text or emojis. Readers scanning docs can instantly spot "warnings" vs. "tips," like road signs for prose.  

---

It's a bit funny: GFM was meant to standardize Markdown, but GitHub itself couldn't resist adding its own spice. Callouts are one of those flavors.  

Do you want me to show you how they'd **actually render on GitHub Docs** (with screenshots / mockup CSS), or just keep it to the Markdown source examples?

### User
what are alerts

### Assistant
"Alerts" are GitHub's name for those special **callout boxes** that show up in their documentation. They're designed to highlight important information, like road signs for text: blue boxes for notes, yellow boxes for warnings, red boxes for danger, and so on.  

They're not part of **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)** itself—so if you drop them in a normal `README.md`, they'll just look like blockquotes with weird text. But in **GitHub Docs** (and any site that uses the same Markdown engine), they render with custom styling.

### The Syntax
Alerts are just blockquotes with a magic tag on the first line:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice goes here.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pay special attention to this.

> [!WARNING]
> You should be careful with this.

> [!CAUTION]
> Danger ahead.
```

### The Rendering
On GitHub Docs, each one turns into a styled box with an icon and color:

- **NOTE** → blue box with an "info" icon  
- **TIP** → green box with a lightbulb  
- **IMPORTANT** → yellow box with an exclamation mark  
- **WARNING** → orange box with a warning triangle  
- **CAUTION** → red box with a stop/danger icon  

### Where They Work
- ✅ GitHub Docs site (docs.github.com, etc.)  
- ✅ Some GitHub-owned wikis/articles  
- ❌ Normal repos (`README.md`, issues, PR comments) — those won't render the styling  

So: alerts are GitHub's **documentation-only extension** to Markdown, basically an admonition system (like in Sphinx, MkDocs, or Docusaurus).  

---

Want me to whip up a **side-by-side mockup** of how one of these looks in plain Markdown vs how it renders as an alert in GitHub Docs? That contrast really shows what makes them special.

### User
tell me about emoji short codes

### Assistant
Emoji shortcodes are one of the most playful GitHub extensions. Instead of hunting around for Unicode emoji, you type a little colon-wrapped keyword and GitHub transforms it into the actual symbol.  

### How it works
In Markdown on GitHub (issues, PRs, comments, READMEs):  

```markdown
:rocket: :tada: :bug: :coffee:
```

…renders as: 🚀 🎉 🐛 ☕  

The syntax is literally `:shortcode:`, with no spaces inside.  

---

### Where you can use them
- Issues and pull requests (great for labels or reactions in text)  
- Comments and discussions  
- README.md and other repo docs (yep, they render inline)  
- GitHub Pages too, since it processes Markdown through GFM  

---

### The emoji library
GitHub uses the **gemoji** library, which has hundreds of codes—some obvious, some delightfully weird. A few fun examples:  

- `:octocat:` → 🐙 (the GitHub mascot, unique to GitHub!)  
- `:shipit:` → 🐿️ (a squirrel; GitHub easter egg)  
- `:sparkles:` → ✨  
- `:construction:` → 🚧  
- `:100:` → 💯  

There's a searchable list at <https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/> and GitHub's own docs.  

---

### Why it's useful
Shortcodes are:  
- **Faster** than copy/paste  
- **Readable in raw Markdown** (`:rocket:` is clearer than a mystery square ▯)  
- **Cross-platform** (no guessing if someone's keyboard has that emoji)  

---

So GitHub flavored Markdown doesn't just speak "developer"; it speaks emoji as a first-class citizen. 🚀✨  

Do you want me to pull together a **cheat sheet of the most GitHub-specific emojis** (like `:octocat:` and `:shipit:`) rather than the standard Unicode ones? Those are the quirky hidden gems.

### User
yes

### Assistant
Perfect—let's unearth the GitHub-specific emoji treasures. These are the oddballs and easter eggs that don't usually show up in other Markdown engines, because GitHub wires them in through its **gemoji** library.

---

## 🐙 GitHub-specific Emoji Shortcodes

- `:octocat:` → ![octocat](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png)  
  The GitHub mascot itself. Doesn't exist as a Unicode character, only here.  

- `:shipit:` → ![shipit](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/shipit.png)  
  A squirrel, referencing the old GitHub "ship it squirrel" meme. Legendary easter egg.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Culture Emojis

These aren't exclusive to GitHub, but they're heavily used in PRs/issues because the shortcodes are intuitive:  

- `:bug:` → 🐛 (bug to fix)  
- `:sparkles:` → ✨ (new feature / magic)  
- `:wrench:` → 🔧 (fix applied)  
- `:tada:` → 🎉 (celebration for merged PRs)  
- `:rocket:` → 🚀 (deploy / release)  
- `:fire:` → 🔥 (big refactor / hotfix)  

---

## 🎭 Meme-y or Fun Shortcodes

- `:poop:` → 💩 (often used for broken builds)  
- `:beer:` → 🍺 (end of sprint vibes)  
- `:clown_face:` → 🤡 (self-deprecating commits)  
- `:see_no_evil:`, `:hear_no_evil:`, `:speak_no_evil:` → 🙈🙉🙊  

---

## 🔍 Where to see them all
- GitHub's emoji picker in issues/PRs: just type `:` and it suggests completions.  
- Full GitHub emoji reference (community-maintained cheat sheet).  

---

So while you can get your standard Unicode emoji anywhere, **`:octocat:` and `:shipit:` are GitHub-exclusive relics of its hacker-culture origins**. They've stuck around because developers love easter eggs.  

Want me to put together a **ready-to-paste Markdown "emoji legend" table** you could drop into a README to give your repo a bit of GitHub-native flavor?

### User
yes

### Assistant
Here's a Markdown-ready **GitHub Emoji Legend** you can drop straight into a README or wiki. It shows the quirky GitHub-specific ones (`:octocat:`, `:shipit:`), plus the "developer culture" ones that give issues and PRs their sparkle ✨.  

```markdown
## 🐙 GitHub Emoji Legend

Here are some fun and useful emoji shortcodes you can use in GitHub Flavored Markdown:

| Shortcode      | Renders As | Meaning / Typical Use |
|----------------|------------|------------------------|
| `:octocat:`    | :octocat:  | GitHub’s mascot — Octocat (GitHub exclusive) |
| `:shipit:`     | :shipit:   | Ship It Squirrel 🐿 — classic GitHub easter egg |
| `:bug:`        | 🐛         | Bug report or fix |
| `:sparkles:`   | ✨         | New feature / magic |
| `:wrench:`     | 🔧         | Fix / maintenance |
| `:tada:`       | 🎉         | Celebrate a merge / milestone |
| `:rocket:`     | 🚀         | Deploy / release |
| `:fire:`       | 🔥         | Major refactor / hotfix |
| `:poop:`       | 💩         | Broken build / mess |
| `:beer:`       | 🍺         | End of sprint / good work |
| `:see_no_evil:`| 🙈         | “Didn’t see that bug…” |
| `:hear_no_evil:`| 🙉        | “Not my problem” humor |
| `:speak_no_evil:`| 🙊      | “Won’t mention this” humor |

---

👉 To use them: just type `:shortcode:` anywhere in your Markdown, and GitHub will render the emoji.
```

That table renders nicely in GitHub Markdown and gives readers a quick "emoji vocabulary" for your project.  

Do you want me to expand this into a **themed set for PR workflow** (like "labels for review, blocked, approved, merged, etc.") so your team can use emojis as a visual language in issues?
