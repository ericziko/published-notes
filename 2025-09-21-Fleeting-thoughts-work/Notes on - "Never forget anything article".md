## Notes

### Why plain text files are important

> First of all, all of the notes are stored as plain text files.
> 
> *Why plain text?*
> 
> 1. **Portability.** I can access this anywhere. Online, offline, GitHub, Mac, Linux, Obsidian, the terminal… I can do anything with my notes and manage them anywhere I want.
> 2. **Adaptability.** The blank canvas of a directory of text files is empowering. I can add whatever functionality I need to, like a robust TODO list solution or an expanded search tool.
> 3. **Durability.** Notion docs last as long as Notion does. Text files last forever.
> 
> [Steph Ango (CEO, Obsidian) published a great piece on the philosophy of “File over app.”](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)
> 
> **File over app** is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.
> 
> All of the files are stored and synced across all my devices, so I always have up-to-date notes. Adding notes on a device without an internet connection is fine, since the sync mechanism will catch back up when the device reconnects.
> 
> I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my GUI for interacting with my knowledge base. Obsidian adds tons of useful tools for managing each note, and I'll get into each of those tools later on here.

## What is the PARA method
*Can you describe the PARA from Building a Second Brain?*

> [!ai] Chat-GPT

The PARA method is a system for organizing digital information, introduced by Tiago Forte in his book "Building a Second Brain." PARA stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. It is designed to help individuals manage their digital life efficiently by categorizing information based on its actionability and relevance. Here's a breakdown of each component:

1. **Projects**: These are short-term efforts that you're actively working on and have a clear goal or outcome. Each project should have a specific deadline or endpoint. This category helps you focus on tasks that need immediate attention.

2. **Areas**: These are ongoing responsibilities without specific deadlines but require regular attention. Examples include health, finances, or family responsibilities. Areas ensure that you maintain balance in different aspects of your life and don't neglect important continuous obligations.

3. **Resources**: This category contains information or materials that might be useful in the future but aren't tied to any specific project or area at the moment. Resources are organized collections of knowledge, insights, or content that you can refer to when needed.

4. **Archives**: Once projects are completed or areas are no longer relevant, the related information can be moved here. Archives serve as storage for past work and knowledge that you might want to reference later but don't need immediate access to.

The PARA method allows for flexibility and adaptability across various tools and platforms by focusing on the structure rather than the medium itself. It helps users quickly locate information based on its purpose and ensures nothing falls through the cracks in their digital organization system.
