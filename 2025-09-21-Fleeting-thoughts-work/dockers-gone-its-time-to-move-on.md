# Docker's Gone — Here's Why It's Time to Move On

[Docker’s Gone — Here’s Why It’s Time to Move On \| by Abhinav \| Medium](https://codingplainenglish.medium.com/docker-is-dead-and-its-about-time-b457d14b0a72)

## Article

Let's cut the noise. Docker was the poster child of DevOps for nearly a decade.

But things have changed. Fast. If you're still treating Docker as your golden hammer in 2025, it's time for a reality check.

This isn't a hate piece. This is a practical breakdown of why Docker is quietly stepping out, and what modern infra teams are doing instead.

## What Docker Did Right

Docker changed how we think about infrastructure. Instead of VMs, we got lightweight containers. Portable, repeatable, and blazing fast (back then).

**Back in 2013–2018:**

- Devs could "Dockerize" an app and ship it.
- CI/CD pipelines got simplified.
- Kubernetes adopted Docker as its default container runtime.
- Everyone and their dog made a `Dockerfile`.

==It was good. Until it wasn't.==

## What Went Wrong?

### 1. The Docker Daemon Problem

Docker relies on a single long-running process — the Docker Daemon. This means:

- It's a **single point of failure**.
- It runs as **root**, which raises red flags for security.
- Debugging the daemon? Good luck. You kill it, you kill everything.

==**Alternatives like containerd**== don't need this central daemon. They're smaller, faster, and don't need God-mode to run.

# Traditional Docker run  
docker run nginx  
  
# With containerd  
ctr run --rm docker.io/library/nginx:latest nginx /bin/sh

## 2. ==Docker Desktop Paywal==l

Docker made the worst move in its lifecycle: **charging developers** for Docker Desktop in enterprise environments.

- Teams started looking for alternatives like **Podman**, **Rancher Desktop**, and **Colima**.
- Developers don't like surprises in their toolchain. This was one.

## 3. Kubernetes Dropped Docker

Let's be clear — Kubernetes **didn't drop containers**. It dropped **Docker as a runtime**.

Instead, it moved to **containerd** and **CRI-O**.

                |  kubelet         |              |  kubelet         |  
                +--------+---------+              +--------+---------+  
                         |                                 |  
             +-----------v------------+        +-----------v------------+  
             |    Docker Daemon       |        |    containerd / CRI-O  |  
             +-----------+------------+        +-----------+------------+  
                         |                                 |  
                   +-----v-----+                     +-----v-----+  
                   | container |                     | container |  
                   +-----------+                     +-----------+

K8s prefers runtimes that implement **CRI** (Container Runtime Interface) natively. Docker doesn't. That added unnecessary shim layers.

## 4. Podman > Docker (for Most Use-Cases)

Podman is basically a drop-in replacement for Docker. But better:

- **Daemonless**
- **Rootless**
- Fully compatible with Docker commands

# Docker  
docker build -t my-app .  
  
# Podman (same)  
podman build -t my-app .

And the best part? You can alias it:

==alias== ==docker=podman==

Most devs wouldn't even know the difference. Except for the fact that Podman is faster and more secure.

## So What Should You Use Instead?

- For **local development**, go with **Podman**, **Colima**, or **NerdCTL**. These are lightweight, fast, and don't require Docker Desktop.
- For **CI/CD pipelines**, use **containerd**. It's more efficient, integrates better with Kubernetes, and doesn't rely on a daemon.
- For **Kubernetes runtime**, prefer **CRI-O** or **containerd**. Both are Kubernetes-native and don't require extra shims.
- For **desktop users**, tools like **Rancher Desktop** (if you want a GUI) or **Podman** (for terminal folks) are excellent alternatives.

## But DockerHub?

Yes, DockerHub is still relevant for image hosting. You can still use it *without* Docker the tool. Tools like `skopeo` or `ctr` can pull from DockerHub.

skopeo copy docker://nginx:latest dir:/tmp/nginx

## Real-World Migration Story

We were running a bunch of microservices using Docker and Docker Compose for local dev. Then we hit:

- Inconsistent dev environments
- CI builds timing out due to Docker caching issues
- Docker Desktop licensing issues

**What we did:**

- Replaced Docker Compose with `podman-compose`
- Used `nerdctl` + containerd in CI
- Switched to `Rancher Desktop` for team members needing GUI

Outcome?

- CI builds were **30% faster**
- Zero licensing issues
- Team onboarded to Podman with zero friction

## Conclusion

==Docker isn't dead.== It's just… **not essential anymore**.

==Like jQuery — it solved a problem that's now solved better by other tools.==

If you're building anything in 2025 and still default to Docker, ask yourself:

> *Is this tool helping me, or am I just using it because I always did?*
